          <i class="title_line"></i>
        </h1>
        <p>The free online diary Journal It offers you the safest place for your thoughts. A comprehensive security concept protects your content against unauthorized access. And this is how it works:</p>
        <p>As soon as content created by you is saved, it is directly encrypted on your computer, i.e. even before its leaves your device and is transferred to the server via the Internet. With this end-to-end encryption approach Journal It set themselves apart from other competitors who do not encrypt user data at all or only provide server-side encryption.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-107 aligncenter" style="height: auto" src="https://www.monkkee.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/encryption_process.png" alt="encryption_process" width="900" height="252"></p>
        <p>The decryption key for Journal It is your password, which you must enter each time you log on. The encryption method used is AES-256. Initially developed for military purposes, this highly secure encoding technology is nowadays used by governments, institutions and banks to encrypt top-secret information.</p>
        <p>The encrypted data is transferred&nbsp;directly between your device and the server. For this purpose, Journal It uses an additional SSL-based encryption technology. That way, no one can eavesdrop on the transfer.</p>
        <p>Only you can decrypt your entries now, since you are the only one to know the password. This means that even the system administrators of Journal It cannot read your data. It also means that it is not possible to hand data over to government authorities, as is currently being discussed in the media. As a side effect, it is not possible to restore your password in case you forget it. So always remember your password â€“ there is no spare key!</p>
